## Roadmap
As gitccentify stagnated in development, I decided to overhaul gitccentify while it's not there in the mainstream yet. The roadmap I plan to follow is right here/
- [ ] Overhaul Gitccentify and release as pint. `*RELEASE MARK`
- [ ] Implement additional features in my backlog

## Contributing
Contributions are currently on hold as I overhaul this project. I'll be accepting contibutions once pint is released.
